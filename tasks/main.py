# N. told his two teammates that he was going to solve all given problems
# at the subregional contest, even if the teammates wouldnâ€™t show up at the competition.

# During the first hour he wants to solve f problems. If there is still some time left
# to the end of the first hour, N. will simply walk along the hall. Beginning
# from the second hour N. wants to spend exactly 45 minutes on each of the problems left.
# If the plan is a success, will N. be able to solve all 12 given problems for 5 hours?
